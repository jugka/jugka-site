Software development is no longer just about writing code – it’s about efficiency, smart solutions, and focusing on what truly matters. AI-powered coding tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, bolt.new, and v0 are transforming the way we build software. This talk provides a comprehensive overview of the tools currently available, their use cases, and their limitations. It explores how these tools automate repetitive tasks, accelerate development processes, and create space for more creative and strategic work. Challenges and limitations are also addressed to provide a realistic perspective on their potential. The goal of this talk is to demonstrate how AI coding tools can optimize workflows and make day-to-day work more productive – without compromising on quality.
