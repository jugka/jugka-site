eBPF is transforming Linux system capabilities, enabling the extension of the Linux kernel with custom process schedulers, firewalls, and more. Thanks to Java's recent advancements in native integration and a bit of compiler magic, we can now create these extensions directly in Java — and that's exactly what this talk is all about.

We'll cover the fundamentals of eBPF and scheduling and how to implement a custom scheduler in Java. The session will include a live demonstration in which we create a scheduler that visualizes scheduling through sound — each process is mapped to a musical note, offering a fun and intuitive way to understand system activity.

Join us for an engaging and informative session, during which you'll learn how to craft small eBPF programs in Java for fun and profit.
