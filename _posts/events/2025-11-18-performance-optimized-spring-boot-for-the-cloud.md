In the era of cloud-native applications, optimizing performance, scalability, and observability is crucial for delivering robust and efficient services. This session will explore best practices for optimizing Spring Boot applications specifically for cloud environments. We will delve into key strategies for enhancing performance, including efficient resource management and asynchronous processing.

Additionally, we will discuss how to implement observability in Spring Boot applications using tools like Spring Actuator, Micrometer, and distributed tracing. Attendees will learn how to monitor application health, track performance metrics, and gain insights into system behavior, enabling proactive troubleshooting and optimization.

By the end of this session, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build and maintain high-performance Spring Boot applications in the cloud, ensuring they can scale effectively while maintaining optimal performance and observability.
